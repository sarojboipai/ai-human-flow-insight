# Update AI Performance Page to AI Activity

Rename and reframe the page content to align with the new "AI Activity" sidebar label.

---

## Change Summary

| File | Action | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `src/pages/AIPerformance.tsx` | Modify | Update title, description, and section headers to use "Activity" framing |

---

## Technical Details

### Changes to AIPerformance.tsx

**1. Update Page Header (lines 41-46)**

| Current | New |
|---------|-----|
| AI Performance | AI Activity |
| "Evaluate AI agent accuracy, bias metrics, and SLA adherence" | "Monitor AI agent actions, decisions, and automation outcomes" |

**2. Update Section Headers**

| Current Header | New Header |
|----------------|------------|
| Weekly Performance Trend | Weekly Activity Trend |
| AI Health Score | AI Decision Quality |
| Core AI Metrics | AI Action Metrics |
| AI Failure Detection | AI Activity Alerts |

**3. Update Metric Card Titles (optional reframe)**

Keep the technical metrics (Match Precision, Match Recall, etc.) as they are accurate descriptors, but the surrounding context will be "activity" focused through the headers and descriptions.

---

## Result

The page will display:
- **Title**: "AI Activity"
- **Description**: "Monitor AI agent actions, decisions, and automation outcomes"
- Section headers reframed around "activity" language
- All underlying metrics and visualizations remain unchanged

This creates consistency between the sidebar label ("AI Activity") and the page content.
